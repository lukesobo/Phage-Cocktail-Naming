# Phage-Cocktail-Naming
Takes an input of a list of phage, checks if a reference cocktail exists. If so, increases cocktail number by 1 for new name. If not, creates new reference cocktail and new cocktail is the first instance ('.001').

Script also removes duplicate cocktails from the inventory before collection upload.

This is the local POC script before workflow was build in Labguru.
